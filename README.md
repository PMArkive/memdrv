# Memory Driver
A simple driver that I made and that I have been using for a while. It hooks dispatch of nsiproxy.sys using absolute call.

Update (8/9/2021): People are messaging me if they can use it on their favourite games to cheat... The answer is no. This driver was a meme that I made for one specific anticheat that had bad integrity checks on some drivers. This has been resolved and therewore this is mostly useless.
